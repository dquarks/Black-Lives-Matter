#### Abstract of Group Project (Exploring the biases & assumptions influencing big data in the Digital Humanities):

In today's world, big data is ubiquitous and has impact that is far-reaching on both individuals and society. Its decision has consequences that are multi-dimensional and affect mindsets both conciously and unconciously. Through our reasearch, we explore the importance of treating big data with a critical lense and ensure that we are using algorithms with healthy skepticism to prevent perpetuating prejudice in terms of race, sex etc. 

#### Abstract of Individual Project (Analyzing Social Movements through the Data Science Lense):

Given the powerful use of social media in the past few weeks, this report was motivated by my desire to explore the Impact of Social Media on Social Movements through Data & Sentiment analysis. Social Media presence has immensely influenced the success of protests and awareness. By looking at the sentiments surrounding the hashtags and seeing their reactions on social networks, the report explores understanding of shocking ways in which social media influences race, religion and gender. Moreover, machine learning is used through bag of words and term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency (tf-idf) to look at how the methodology can be made more robust for larger words base.
